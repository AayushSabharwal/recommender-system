IDEAS

1. Supervised random walk based algorithm, refer to https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/linkpred-wsdm11.pdf
2. Split form movie results into training and test sets. Use method in above link to get the final vector w
3. First idea for generating graph => Use ranks obtained in form to give weights to different parameters, rank similarity for every pair of movies on this basis.
   Then, include as many edges as needed to ensure the graph is connected, then add a "few" extra
4. Second idea for generating graph => Use ranks obtained to generate graph, iteratively create vector w as in (2), use this to recreate the graph, and repeat.
   No mathematical proof for soundness or convergence of this.
5. Use test set to verify how accurate this is
6. Use some sort of similarity measure to identify very similar tags? Would help tag based categorisation
7. Instead of above, maybe use fuzzy search esque similarity scores for each tag in all other tags of a pair of movies. Basically, while comparing movies u and v,
   for every tag in u, generate a similarity score in v. This results in a similarity matrix, whose dominant eigenvector will give tag similarity
